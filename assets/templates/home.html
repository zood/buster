    <h4>Share Your Location</h4>
    <p>With Zood Location, your family and loved ones can continuously share their location with each other, so you can make sure everyone is safe with a quick glance at your phone. No more having to text and call each person to find out where they are, and where they are headed.</p>

    <h4>Safe and secure</h4>
    <p>Using end-to-end encryption your location is always protected. Zood encrypts your location before it leaves your phone so it can only be decrypted by the person you're sharing with. No companies can track you or sell your information.</p>
